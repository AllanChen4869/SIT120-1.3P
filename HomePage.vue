      <p>Hello my name is Jiayang, a beginner web developer with a passion for crafting digital experiences. My journey began in 2023, fueled by a blend of curiosity and creativity. Since then, I've spent countless hours diving deep into the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>As someone who is relatively new to the expansive world of web development, I've always believed that starting from scratch isn't a drawback but rather an opportunity â€” an opportunity to learn without boundaries, to ask questions, and to reimagine the norms. While I may be at the early stages of my career, my portfolio showcases a range of projects that demonstrate both my technical proficiency and creative flair. From responsive layouts to interactive user interfaces, I've tried my hand at various elements of front-end development.</p>
